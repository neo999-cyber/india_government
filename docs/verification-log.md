## Standing rules
1. `status: verified` only when pinned to a named primary/institutional source **in a logged cycle** with URL. Report-derived figures stay `approx`.
2. WDI panel pulls: whole panel at once, one vintage, date recorded in `source.vintage`. Never refresh one country alone (P-09).
3. Corrections propagate: when a verified value contradicts phase-1 report prose (as solar 2.82 did), the series file wins and the discrepancy is noted here.

# Verification log — cycle 2026-07-30 (Phase 2, macro/fiscal)

## Contract change required
**The project assumed two GDP regimes. There are now three.** MoSPI released a 2022-23 base series on 27 Feb 2026 (P-10). CLAUDE.md rule 5 currently reads "Both GDP series always" — it must become "all three regimes". FY24 and FY25 now have two valid growth figures each (FY24: 8.2 / 7.2; FY25: 6.5 / 7.1) and no spliced back-series exists yet. Sources and Methods documentation is due August 2026 — a re-baselining trigger.

The rebasing also lowered the *level* of nominal GDP by 3-4%, which mechanically raises every ratio-to-GDP in the project (deficit, debt, exports, GFCF, tax) with no change in underlying activity. Any chart of those ratios spanning Feb 2026 must carry the denominator break.

## New provenance records
P-10 third GDP rebasing · P-11 CPI base revision to 2024 · P-12 IIP/WPI revisions and new PPI · P-13 fiscal anchor shifts from deficit to debt (FY27) · P-14 WDI fiscal-year labelling for India vs calendar years for peers.

## Reconciliation resolved
Phase 1 recorded exports at **25.4% of GDP (FY2013-14, T1)**; Phase 2's WDI pull gives **22.97% for "2014"**. Not a contradiction — different period bases (P-14). WDI labels India's fiscal years by starting year. **This convention is stated from general knowledge and must be verified against WDI documentation before the peer views ship.**

## Status discipline applied
Only three points marked `verified` this cycle (the two 2022-23 base growth figures and the FY14 new-base figure, all from the MoSPI press note). Everything else in the FY15-FY26 macro table is `approx` — the Phase 2 report itself flags that several inflation, reserves and rupee cells are T2-derived. They must be replaced with exact T1 RBI/CGA annual series before any published view.

# Verification log — cycle 2026-07-31 (Phase 3, banking)

## Correction to phase-1 data
`psb-gross-npa` carried an AQR break pointing at **P-06 (off-budget borrowing and fiscal accounting)** — the wrong provenance record entirely. It passed validation because the reference *resolved*; nothing checked that it resolved to something relevant. Repointed to the new **P-15 (AQR recognition break)** and the series extended to FY2013-14 through FY2025-26.

**Validator gap this exposes:** a break's `provenanceRef` should be checked against the referenced record's `affectsDomains`. P-06 covers `macro`; `psb-gross-npa` is `banking` — a domain cross-check would have caught it. Implemented as a semantic check in this cycle's validation run; Code should add it to `npm run validate`.

## The decisive finding
Banks wrote off **₹16,61,310 crore** (April 2014-September 2024) and recovered **₹2,69,795 crore — about 16%**. This is what makes the banking verdict "worked with an asterisk" rather than "worked". The headline fall from 14.58% to 1.8% has three drivers that the ratio does not separate: genuine recoveries and upgrades (~42.8% of the FY2024-25 reduction, per RBI), write-offs, and credit growth expanding the denominator (₹66.91 → ₹181.34 lakh crore, 2015-2025).

**Instrument requirement (P-17):** every longitudinal NPA chart must offer an adjusted series — gross NPAs plus cumulative write-offs over the same denominator — alongside the reported one.

## New provenance records
P-15 AQR recognition break · P-16 COVID forbearance · P-17 write-offs and denominator growth · P-18 domestic vs global operations basis · P-19 risk-weight changes and partial rollback · P-20 RBI fraud reporting basis change · P-21 ECL transition (1 April 2027).

## P-18 is a live trap
The commonly cited PSB peak of **14.58% is global-operations basis**; the SCB figure for the same period on **domestic operations is 11.46%**. Official sources mix the two without labelling. Every NPA point in the dataset is now tagged with its basis, and P-18 forbids cross-basis comparison.

## P-20 is provisional and must not ship
The RBI's reported change of fraud reporting from date-of-detection to date-of-occurrence is asserted across secondary sources but **the primary circular and effective date have not been located**. No fraud time series may be published until this is pinned. Highest-priority verification item this cycle.

## Status discipline
Three points marked `verified` (PSB GNPA FY2017-18, FY2020-21, FY2024-25 — all direct from PIB releases) plus PSB profit FY2024-25. Everything else `approx`. The consolidated annual table in the phase-3 report is explicitly indicative, interpolated from RBI FSR and Trend & Progress narrative, and must be replaced with exact RBI series before any published view.
